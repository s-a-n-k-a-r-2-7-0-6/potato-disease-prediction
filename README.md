# potato-disease-prediction
This is an classification problem in which the dataset contains the pictures of different potato leaves which when sent through this problem it determines the disease of the potato leaf and and it also tells us accuracy and confidence of the output it determined and due to some local machinne issues it was not deployed and only the training code is commited.I have used deep learning techniques and neural network layers in this to increase its reliability.
